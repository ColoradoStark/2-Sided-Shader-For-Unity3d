# 2-Sided-Shader-For-Unity3d
Written By Colorado Stark

This is a 2 sided shader written for Unity Game Engine.
Unity does not have the option to check box make shaders 2 sided.  
And sometimes things like hair or clothes look broken. because from the wrong angle the object becomes invisible.  
This shader has 2 sides and will fill the invisible holes in broken hair and other objects.
